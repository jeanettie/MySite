# MySite
New version of my artist website. I just changed my nameservers to route me domain to my new hosting, it should take effect in the coming days. http://jeanettie.com . However, I just got a working version of my site up at another domain. http://jeanettenicolebrown.  Also, you can run by simply launching index.html in a browser after downloading it into a text editor and go from there.
